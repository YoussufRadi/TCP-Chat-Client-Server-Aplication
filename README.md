# TCP-Chat-Client-Server-Application
A TCP Chat Client-Server Application developed used Java Socket programming 

###Project Description
The objective of this project is to gain experience in developing a network application based on the client/server architecture. Using sockets API, through designing a chat application that is composed of a network of two interconnected chat servers. Once users are connected to one of the chat servers, they can converse with other users connected to the other chat server.

The system consists of two chat servers connected together. Each chat server can handle multiple clients and is connected to the other server. Half the list of clients is maintained at each server. You should consider two different scenarios:
- Two users connected to the same server chatting with each other. In this case the message will be directed through their local chat server, no routing is needed.
- Two users connected to two different servers chatting with each other. In this case, the server of the initiator client must forward the message to the second chat server.
Moreover you can check report for specific details about the project
